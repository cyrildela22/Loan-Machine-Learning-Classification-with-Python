# Loan-Machine-Learning-Classification-with-Python
## Project Details /Overview
This project is part of a final machine learning project in "Data Analysis Using Python" course on Coursera offered by IBM and its primary objective is to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in this course.
The provided dataset is about past loans. The __Loan_train.csv__ data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

The goal of the project is to use machine learning model(KNN, Random Forest, Adaboost) to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not using attributes or features such as principal, terms (origination term can be weekly, biweekly and month payoff schedule), Age, education, gender and so on.
